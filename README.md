# Jamyxgo
Go client library for jamyxer.
This library was created for development of [jamyxui](github.com/javyre/jamyxui).
This is a wrapper of some [jamyxer](github.com/javyre/jamyxer) commands passed to the server via tcp.

# Installation
    go get github.com/javyre/jamyxgo
    
# Usage
```golang
import "github.com/javyre/jamyxer"
```
Usage should be pretty simple. Take a look at the source code. If there ever is demand, I could generate some docs or something.
